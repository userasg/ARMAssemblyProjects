# ARMAssemblyProjects
A collection of ARM assembly projects and tasks written to enhance understanding of ARM Assembly programming

## Komodo
[Komodo](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/). This is the software used to compile and run the programs 

## decInput
*Decimal Input Program*: An ARM assembly program that captures a positive decimal integer from the user as ASCII characters, converts them to an integer, handles errors, stores the integer in memory, and displays the result.


## fibonacci
*Fibonacci Sequence Generator*: iterative ARM program to calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified value.

## ipGenerator
*IP Input Program*: an ARM assembly program that prompts the user to enter an IPv4 address in dotted-quad format, reads and validates the input for integer input, stores the four integers representing the address, checks for validity, and prints the IP address if it's valid.

## textEditor
*TextEditor Program*:These files represent a series of ARM assembly programs designed to manipulate text formatting, including breaking lines at word boundaries, maintaining line length, and supporting real-time text input and editing.
